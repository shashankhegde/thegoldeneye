ABSTRACT

The ubiquity of internet enabled smartphones enables us to
always remain connected. Applications on mobile phones
such as Facebook, Twitter, etc provide us a convenient way
of keeping in touch with our family and friends. But at the
same time, these very applications are also a source of a
wealth of private information. Previous studies [1](1.md) have
shown that sharing of mobile phones is very prevalent. This
raises a number of privacy concerns. In order to protect
users’ privacy concerns, we propose GoldenEye, a face
recognition based authentication system for smartphone
applications. GoldenEye is an additional layer between the
application and the users’ login credentials which
recognizes the current phone user by taking their picture
and the application is allowed to use the credentials only if
the current user is authorized by the phone owner.
